# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
nums needs to be declared before the function. Otherwise it's being declared in the function and cannot be declared again.

Not quite, it is because we are invoking the callback function.
