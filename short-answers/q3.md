# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
We aren't supposed to invoke `printDouble` since it's a callback function.

# Teacher Feedback

Not quite, it is because we are invoking the callback function.
